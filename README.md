## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an app that retrieves information from OpenWeather API and 
display the daily weather forecast every 3 hours for the next five days for a specific city. 
Clicking on the city gives the user a detailed view of the city's weather information, 
including a map view with a pin on the city's coordinates. The search bar gives the user the
possibility to search for weather information for any city.

(This project is still a work in progress :D)
